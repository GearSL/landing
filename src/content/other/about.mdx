Hi, there. I am looking for an internship or a job for a Java developer vacancy. Convenient remote work format. The current goal is to catch up with hard skills and switch tech stack.

🌍  I'm based in Kostanay

🚀  I'm currently working in Tinkoff

🧠  I'm learning Java and Spring framework

🤝  I'm open to collaborating on any Java or Spring-based projects
